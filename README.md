// How i should have create this coding to make things better - reflection

Question 1:
I probably should have planned things out more before I started coding. If I had spent a little more time looking at how all the data pieces (CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, etc.) fit together, it would have been easier to write the code for it.

Question 2:
The process of iterating through nested arrays and objects to calculate the weighted average and format the final output was intricate. In the future, taking the time to write smaller, more focused helper functions for each specific task would make the code cleaner and easier to debug. For instance, having one function to calculate the score for a single assignment, another for the learner's overall average, and a third for formatting the final output would improve code organization.

Question 3:
I would improve the error handling to provide more descriptive messages. Instead of a generic "Invalid input" error, the program could specify which part of the data is incorrect, making it easier for the user to fix the issue.

Question 4:
Always take the time to plan your approach before writing any code. This includes understanding the requirements, analyzing the data structures, and breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable pieces.
